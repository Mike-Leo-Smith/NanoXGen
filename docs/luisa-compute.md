# LuisaCompute `next` execution backend

NanoXGen can consume a separately built LuisaCompute `next` tree as an explicit
JIT execution backend. It is never downloaded, discovered, or linked by the
default CPU, CUDA, HIP, or Autodesk presets. LuisaCompute sources, submodules,
shader caches, runtime plug-ins, and build products must remain outside this
repository.

The tested upstream revision is
`c07bc0824aebb97784cdaff6e2c34b77acab20a8`. The `next` branch moves, so record
the exact revision used for every benchmark.

## AMD HIP build

Clone recursively outside NanoXGen, then use the checked-in helper to configure
only the WIP HIP backend:

```bash
git clone --branch next --recursive \
  https://github.com/LuisaGroup/LuisaCompute.git \
  /external/LuisaCompute-next

NANOXGEN_HIP_ARCH=gfx1201 \
./scripts/build_luisa_compute_next.sh \
  /external/LuisaCompute-next \
  /external/LuisaCompute-next/build-nanoxgen-hip
```

LuisaCompute `next` currently uses an LLVM API newer than the headers bundled
with some ROCm releases. The helper deliberately selects system LLVM through
`LLVM_DIR` while still finding HIP/HIPRTC and AMD device libraries under
`ROCM_PATH` (defaults: `/usr/lib/cmake/llvm` and `/opt/rocm`). Override either
environment variable for another installation. This is an isolated build
choice; no Maya or system libraries are copied or replaced.

Configure NanoXGen against the source and build trees:

```bash
export LUISA_COMPUTE_SOURCE_DIR=/external/LuisaCompute-next
export LUISA_COMPUTE_BUILD_DIR=/external/LuisaCompute-next/build-nanoxgen-hip

cmake --preset luisa-hip-release
cmake --build --preset luisa-hip-release
ctest --preset luisa-hip-release
```

The imported CMake adapter consumes LuisaCompute's narrow DSL/runtime shared
libraries and loads the selected backend plug-in at runtime. It does not use
`add_subdirectory`: the upstream HIP build currently refers to its top-level
source directory while compiling HIPRT, so a standalone upstream build is the
reproducible integration boundary.

## Float-only expression lowering

`nanoxgen_luisa_tests` records a C++ kernel into Luisa AST/XIR, JIT-compiles it,
uploads 65,536 inputs, evaluates deterministic integer hash and float width
operations, downloads both outputs, and compares every value with the CPU
oracle. It also compiles a bounded Classic scalar expression, lowers that SSA
program into the same Luisa kernel, and checks every downloaded result. It
prints compilation time, upload/dispatch/download time, expression dispatch
time, error bounds, and a stable checksum. A second process also exercises
LuisaCompute's shader cache.

The runtime boundary is deliberately typed: `XgenFloatExpressionProgram`
contains float immediates and the Luisa lowering accepts only that program
type. Device contexts, inputs, expression values, hashes, and random values use
only `float` and `uint32`. The strict Autodesk/SeExpr calibration evaluator is
a separate CPU path that retains `double`, because replacing it would make the
oracle itself inaccurate. It is converted once to the compact float runtime IR
and is never captured by a Luisa callable or kernel.

The fast float hash/random sequence is NanoXGen-stable but is not bit-compatible
with Autodesk's double-based SeExpr sequence. This is an explicit execution
mode, not an unnoticed precision change. Strict Autodesk acceptance tests keep
using the CPU calibration mode.

For a generated-code audit, LuisaCompute's HIP backend can dump its optimized
LLVM IR outside the repository:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/nanoxgen-llvm-audit
cd /tmp/nanoxgen-llvm-audit
LUISA_DUMP_LLVM_IR=1 \
  /path/to/nanoxgen_luisa_tests /path/to/luisa/runtime hip
rg 'double|f64|llvm\.fma\.f64' hip_kernel_after_opt_*.ll
```

No match is expected for NanoXGen's kernels. The July 2026 RX 9070 XT
(`gfx1201`) run produced no FP64 match in either optimized kernel.

This proves that the actual LuisaCompute HIP runtime works on the selected AMD
device and that the supported bounded scalar IR is JIT-lowered, not interpreted
on the host. Authored `rampUI` values are parsed into constant control points
and lowered with flat, linear, smooth, and spline interpolation. This is not yet
a claim that a complete Classic XGen description is natively evaluable.
Unsupported SeExpr, PTEX, modules, and topology operations remain checked errors
and select the Autodesk fallback until their CPU oracle and Luisa differential
tests pass.
